Accordingly, this study focused on understanding octopus paralarval dispersal using numerical mod- eling. A Lagrangian approach was implemented using the transport model ICHTHYOP and surface currents from a GoM simulation of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). We modeled the dispersal of four octopus species from the GoM (Octopus “vulgaris”, Octopus insularis, Macrotritopus defilippi, and Amphioctopus burryi), consider- ing two regions as the source of larvae in the southern GoM, namely the Yucatan shelf and the Veracruz coastal waters. Additionally, an environmental suitability analysis was incorporated using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to establish poten- tial settlement areas under the influence of the water masses’ thermal conditions. The simulation results supported the hypothesis that the abundances recorded in the GoM were influenced by the fertility (egg- laying) of each species, surface water cir- culation (the Loop Current, eddies, and wind), and sea surface temperature. Greater dispersal was obtained throughout the GoM for Yucatan species O. “vulgaris”, regis- tering the highest settlement rates. In contrast, in Veracruz, O. insularis dispersed and settled only in the western portion of the GoM. The relevance of the ecological de- scriptors proposed to influence the dispersal and abundance of octopods throughout the GoM's coastal waters are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Dispersal modeling of octopoda paralarvae in the Gulf of Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josymar Torrejón-Magallanes","Luis Enrique Ángeles-González","Jorge Csirke","Marilú Bouchón","Enrique Morales-Bojorquez","Francisco Arreguín-Sánchez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"4277a43e2287adff465eed9f1d10f40d","permalink":"/publication/article_10/","publishdate":"2021-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_10/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Modeling the Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) environmental niche and future scenarios in the northern Peruvian Current system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Enrique Ángeles-González","Elena Solana-Arellano","Victoria Díaz-Castañeda","Olga Flores-Uzeta","Maricarmen Neoechea-Zamora"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"f1675a011620f1f918bc8a818654d558","permalink":"/publication/article_7/cite/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_7/cite/","section":"publication","summary":"This work constitutes an effort to evaluate benthic biodiversity in Bahía de Los Ángeles, Gulf of California, Mexico. To charac- terize macrofauna at the family level, 2 sampling campaigns took place during summer 2013 and winter 2014 at 6 coastal stations. A total of 18,403 invertebrates were collected, 7,880 in summer and 10,523 in winter. These invertebrates were grouped into 6 phyla and 110 families, comprising 39 mollusks, 33 crustaceans, 30 polychaetes, 5 echinoderms, 2 cnidarians, and 1 cephalochordate. In both sampling periods, mol- lusks were the dominant group, especially in summer, followed by polychaetes and crustaceans, which were more abundant in winter. Ten new records were established for the area. The most abundant trophic groups were deposit feeders and carnivores.

The different thermal tolerances elicited different responses to current and future scenarios. In this sense, O. insularis and O. maya thermal niches stretch from the Caribbean to Florida. Nevertheless, O. insularis may inhabit warmer areas than O. maya. Surprisingly, no area was considered thermally habitable for O. americanus, which could have been associated with the use of data of populations thermally adapted to temperate conditions south of Brazil. According to models, a warming scenario would cause a re- striction of the available thermal niche of O. maya, while O. insularis could expand under RCP 6 scenarios. This restriction was more substantial in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Nevertheless, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the temperature in 2100 may negatively affect even O. insularis, the species most thermal tolerant. If our results are accurate, the fishing yield of O. insularis will increase in the future, replacing the heavily exploited O. maya in the coasts of the southern Gulf of Mexico. Regarding O. americanus, no inference might be made until thermal tolerances of locally adapted populations can be studied.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Exploring the effects of warming seas by using the optimal and pejus temperatures of the embryo of three Octopoda species in the Gulf of Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Enrique Ángeles-González","Enrique Martínez-Meyer","Carlos Yañez-Arenas","Iván Velázquez-Abunader","Adriana Garcia-Rueda","Fernando Díaz","Nelly Tremblay","Marco Antonio Flores-Rivero","Paulina Gebauer","Carlos Rosas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"919d0ba50b903c64a5689131f9c2c27f","permalink":"/publication/article_3/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_3/","section":"publication","summary":"Temperature is recongnised as the main factor controlling the species fitness and performance. Naturally, the thermal preferences (TP) of aquatic organisms obtained in controlled conditions have been used to relate physiological performance with field data since they are a good proxy to the fundamental niche. Literature suggests that dispersal capabilities, biological interactions, acclimatisation, adaptation, among others might play a role in species distribution; thus, in reality, species are usually occupying a realized thermal niche (RTN). Therefore, this study was designed to inquire into the following questions; Are the TP of tropical aquatic ectotherms found in laboratory conditions similar to their RTN? Can TP be validated with occurrences in the wild? To answer these questions, this study compared the TP obtained from previously published works with the RTN of the crabs Callinectes similis and C. sapidus, the fishes Centropomus undecimalis and Ocyurus chrysurus, the lobster Panulirus argus, and the octopus Octopus maya obtained from occurrences from 1693 documents. When RTN values were tested against the TPs obtained in laboratory, no significant differences were found for fish species (P  0.05); in contrast, differences for the benthic invertebrates were reported (P ","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Using realized thermal niche to validate thermal preferences from laboratory studies.

Considering the current trend of increasing seawater temperature, warm-water species are expected to expand their geographic distribution ranges. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is an important tool to help describe likely changes in geographic distribution patterns of a species in different climatic scenarios. To evaluate changes in the distribution of Octopus insularis over time, the maximum entropy approach was used, which estimated a suitable climatic niche for Octopus under 5 scenarios of global climate change. Four environmental variables were chosen to model the suitable climatic niche of O. insularis in the present, past, and future scenarios. The ENM in different climatic scenarios showed good validation and pointed out an increase of the suitable niche for O. insularis settlement, from the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya) up to future scenarios. In the future projections, suitable niche space will potentially increase in the tropical Atlantic compared to the current distribution. Modeling pointed out the possibility of expansion from the current range of the species to the temperate northern Atlantic, temperate South America, and temperate South Africa. This may cause potential threats, such as possible extinction of endemic species, habitat displacement of native octopuses, and reorganizations in the trophic chain.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Global climate changes over time shape the environmental niche distribution of Octopus insularis in the Atlantic Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591142400,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"This is an R-package to estimate Size at Morphometric and Gonadal Maturity for organisms, usually fish and invertebrates.

In fact, most of the biological studies of this species refer to the fraction of the population that occupies waters less than 30 m deep; however, O. maya can occur up to a 60 m depth. The aim of this study is to assess the stock of O. maya that occupies waters between 30 m and 60 m deep. Four research cruises were carried out during the closed and fishing seasons, from May 2016 to January 2017. An average of 29 sampling sites were surveyed in each cruise (±2 sampling sites) using a commercial vessel with a uniform sampling effort. In each sampling site, the swept area, the total number of octopuses captured, the total weight of the catch, and the individual weight of octopuses were recorded. Biomass was obtained with four methods; stratified random method, swept area method, geostatistical biomass model, and an unpublished method of weighted swept area. The four methods provided consistent results. The distribution pattern of species was in patches, although before the fishing season started it was more homogeneous. The fraction of the population that occurs between 30 m and 60 m deep consisted mostly of adult organisms, so it could be contributing significantly to the recruitment of the entire population, even to the fraction that is exploited.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Biomass and distribution of the red octopus (Octopus maya) in the north-east of the Campeche Bank","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The aim of the present study was to go beyond laboratory studies under controlled temperatures to examine the possible relationship between large-scale thermal patterns and reproductive season (represented by functional maturation) of O. maya in the wild on the continental shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula, where it is endemic. The macroscopic maturity index (MaMI) was obtained in females, and reproductive complex index (RCI) and number of spermatophores in males. Associations Associations between these indices and environmental temperature regime were inferred by sampling octopuses in an upwelling zone (Z-I), a transition zone (Z-II) and a nonupwelling zone (Z-III). The reproductive condition of O. maya differed between Z-I and Z-III. In all zones, the pro- portion of adults showing functional maturity was highest in both females (MaMI 36-71% of values ≤0.2) and males (RCI 12–40% of values ≥0.9; 41–49 spermatophores per octopus) during the season of winter storms ('nortes' season, November–February), when the sea-surface temperature oscillates around 25 °C. In Z-I, some individuals were functionally mature throughout the year, likely due to low temperatures maintained by summer upwelling. Zone-I had the greatest proportion of functionally mature males (up to 40% of adults in ‘nortes’ season) and the greatest number of spermatophores (mean 43–49 spermatophores per octopus in all seasons). Females in Z-III (without upwelling) were functionally mature mainly in the ‘nortes’ season when water temperature decreased, with only a small proportion mature in the rest of the year when water temperatures reached 31 °C. As  predicted by laboratory studies, water temperature below 27 °C appears to be favourable for the functional reproductive maturation of wild O. maya.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Temperature modulates spatio-temporal variability of the functional reproductive maturation of Octopus maya (Cephalopoda) on the shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","type":"publication"}]
