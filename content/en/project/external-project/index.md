summary: This is an R-package to estimate Size at Morphometric and Gonadal Maturity for organisms, usually fish and invertebrates. It includes methods for classification based on relative growth (principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, discriminant analysis), logistic regression (frequentist or Bayes), parameters estimation and some basic plots. The estimation of morphometric maturity used two allometric variables and is based on the relative growth. On the other hand, the estimation of gonadal maturity used one allometric variable and the stage of sexual maturity (gonad maturation stage).
