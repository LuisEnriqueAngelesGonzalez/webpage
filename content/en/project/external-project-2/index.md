summary: This project is focus on the Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) using different tools such as *kuenm* and *ntbox* R packages. I am working with climate change scenarios to assess the vulnerability of commercially important marine species, such as red octopus (*Octopus maya*) in Mexico and Pacific chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) in Peru.
